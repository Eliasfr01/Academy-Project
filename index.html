      <h2 class="section__title">Benefits of Exercise</h2>
      <img class="section__img-inline" src="img/pegando_peso.jpg" alt="Weight being picked up">
      <p class="section__text-inline">Working out brings numerous benefits to both your body and mind.
        Not only does it help you build strength and muscle tone, but it also
        improves your overall health. Regular exercise boosts your metabolism,
        helping you maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic
        diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, sweating it
        out at the gym releases endorphins, the body's natural mood lifters,
        leaving you feeling energized and revitalized.
      </p>
      <p class="section__text-inline">Beyond the physical advantages, hitting the gym can also enhance
        your mental well-being. Exercise is a great stress reliever, helping
        you to clear your mind and improve your mood. It can boost your
        confidence and self-esteem as you achieve your fitness goals,
        and the sense of accomplishment carries over into other areas of your life.
        So, whether it's lifting weights, hitting the treadmill, or joining a group
        class, making exercise a part of your routine can lead to a happier, healthier you.

      <img class="section__img" src="img/bike.jpg" alt="Person riding a bike">
      <p class="section__text">Cardio exercises offer a host of benefits for your body and mind.
        They strengthen your heart, lower blood pressure, and improve circulation,
        reducing the risk of heart disease and strokes. Plus, they're excellent
        for burning calories, maintaining a healthy weight, and boosting mood through
        the release of endorphins. So, whether it's running, cycling, or swimming,
        adding cardio to your routine is a smart choice for overall health and well-being.
